# This mod specific (don't ignore source native code, but ignore compiled intermediate inputs in src if any)
# But we DO want to commit the final dylib if usage requires it, 
# however, standard practice is to build it. 
# The user's build process seems to build it in src/main/native and copy it to resources.
# We should probably ignore the compiled dylib in resources if it's strictly a build artifact,
# BUT for a mod repo, sometimes people commit the dylib so others don't need Xcode.
# Given the workflow builds it, it's safer to IGNORE it to ensure CI builds it fresh.
# However, if the user wants to distribute it easily, maybe not.
# Let's stick to standard practice: Ignore build artifacts.
